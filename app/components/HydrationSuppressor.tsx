/**
 * Hydration Suppressor Component
 * 
 * Empty component used to handle Next.js hydration issues by suppressing
 * hydration warnings during development. This helps prevent console errors
 * related to server-side rendering mismatches with client-side rendering.
 * 
 * Note: This file is currently empty but serves as a placeholder for
 * potential hydration suppression utilities if needed in the future.
