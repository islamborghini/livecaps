   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with your API keys:
   ```
   DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=your_deepgram_api_key
   DEEPL_API_KEY=your_deepl_api_key
   ```

4. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser

## Usage

1. Allow microphone access when prompted
2. Start speaking to see real-time transcription in the "Original" panel
3. Select a target language from the dropdown menu to see translations in the right panel
4. The audio visualization at the bottom provides feedback on your audio input

## Configuration

You can configure the transcription behavior in the `app/context/DeepgramContextProvider.tsx` file:

- `model`: Change the Deepgram model (default: "nova-3")
- `smart_format`: Enable/disable smart formatting (default: true)
- `interim_results`: Enable/disable interim results (default: true)
- `utterance_end_ms`: Adjust the pause detection duration (default: 2000ms)
